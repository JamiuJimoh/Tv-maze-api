# Tv Maze API project
---
## Main Features

* An input search field and a button for users to search for tv shows.
* When users submits their input value, a request should be made to the [Tv Maze](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) server, requesting for the first 10 (default amount) results to display to the user.

## Objectives
* Fetch data using the [Tv Maze](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) API and design your page to display the results.
* Display the poster and title for each result, if there is.

## Optional
* Each poster should be clickable or should have a button.
* When clicked, you should display more info about the clicked item.
* Infos like;
    * Plot
    * Ratings
    * Genre
    * Premiered
    * You can take a look at the result from the api and decide what other info you want to add.

**Finally, you can take this to the next level and design it however you like. This could be on your portfolio if you take it serious**
